# Called by "git push" after it has checked the remote status,
# but before anything has been pushed.
#
# If this script exits with a non-zero status nothing will be pushed.
#
# Steps to install, from the root directory of your repo...
# 1. Copy the file into your repo at `.git/hooks/pre-push`
# 2. Set executable permissions, run `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push`
#
# Try a force push to master, you should get a message `*** [Policy] never push to master`
#
# The commands below will not be allowed...
# `git push --force origin master`
# `git push --delete origin master`
# `git push origin :master`
#
# Nor will a force push while on the master branch be allowed...
# `git co master`
# `git push --force origin`

# Requires git 1.8.2 or newer
